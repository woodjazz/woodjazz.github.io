These are some games I made with Unity3D:

- [ClaudioArt](http://woodjazz.github.io/ClaudioArt/)
- [MonitoChips](http://woodjazz.github.io/MonitoChips/)
- [NaturalNums](http://woodjazz.github.io/NaturalNums/)
- [SpaceScenesAAA](http://woodjazz.github.io/SpaceScenesAAA/)

Also, you can take a look at my c++ game engine:

- [nsg-library](https://github.com/woodjazz/nsg-library)

This is a demo using nsg-library:
