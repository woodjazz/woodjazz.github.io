These are some games I made with Unity3D:

- [ClaudioArt](http://woodjazz.github.io/ClaudioArt/)
- [MonitoChips](http://woodjazz.github.io/MonitoChips/)
- [NaturalNums](http://woodjazz.github.io/NaturalNums/)
- [SpaceScenesAAA](http://woodjazz.github.io/SpaceScenesAAA/)

This is a C++ game engine and framework that I have been working on:

- [nsg-library](https://github.com/woodjazz/nsg-library). Features:

	- Cross-platform. Currently runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and HTML5 with Emscripten toolchain.
	- OpenGL 2.0, OpenGL ES 2.0 or WebGL rendering.
	- SceneNode model.
	- Keyframe animation.
	- Skeletal animation (with hardware skinning).
	- Point, spot and directional lights.
	- Shadow mapping for all light types; cascaded shadow maps for directional lights.
	- Physics.
	- HTTP requests.
	- Image loading.
	- IMGUI.
	- Audio.
	- Ability to convert blender files.
