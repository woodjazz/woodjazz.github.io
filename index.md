These are some free games I made with Unity3D:

- [ClaudioArt](http://woodjazz.github.io/ClaudioArt/)
- [MonitoChips](http://woodjazz.github.io/MonitoChips/)
- [NaturalNums](http://woodjazz.github.io/NaturalNums/)
- [SpaceScenesAAA](http://woodjazz.github.io/SpaceScenesAAA/)



[nsg-library](https://github.com/woodjazz/nsg-library). This is a C++ game engine and framework that I have been working on. Features:

- Cross-platform. Currently runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and HTML5 with Emscripten toolchain.
- OpenGL 2.0, OpenGL ES 2.0 or WebGL rendering.
- Scene graph.
- Keyframe animation.
- Skeletal animation (with hardware skinning).
- Point, spot and directional lights.
- Shadow mapping for all light types; cascaded shadow maps for directional lights.
- Events controlled by signals and slots.
- Physics (using bullet library).
- HTTP requests.
- Image loading.
- IMGUI.
- Audio.
- Exporter for blender files.

These are some examples (from the samples folder) generated with the Emscripten toolchain.
They can run them in your browser:
